## A React Native Mobile App for Tracking Reading Habits
I wanted to create an app that would help book lovers track their reading habits and make it easier to stay motivated and engaged with their reading goals.
That's why I developed ReadingHabit, a mobile app built using React Native.

ReadingHabit is a simple and intuitive app that allows users to track their reading progress, set goals. 

With ReadingHabit, users can:

- Log the number of books they've read and the percentage of their reading goals they've achieved
- Keep track of their favorite genres and see their reading habits in the form of a pie chart
- Record their favorite quotes and notes for each book
- Set wish books and add books to their reading list
- Keep track of the books they're currently reading and the books they've finished reading
